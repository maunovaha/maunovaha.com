<p>Hi, I'm Mauno V채h채 and I have an interesting journey ahead. But first, let me briefly introduce myself.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  I'm a 28 years old, programmer by work/hobby, student, CS:GO player and a dude (obviously).
</p>

<p>
  I've been programming for a quite sometime, many years actually. I got my first experiences to programming over 13 years ago when notepad was still a superb text editor and internet explorer 6 "amazing" browser. Hence, at first, I didn't really knew whether I should become a programmer or a graphic designer; I liked them both. It was only later that I grew to like programming more, mostly because of my studies.
</p>

<p>
  That being said, I've also been studying for a while. I first graduated as a media assistant with a focus on web programming/multimedia and later on received bachelor's degree in information processing science with a focus on software development. Yet, my master's degree is still pending, but I have a good chance to graduate during upcoming year (yay!). Thus, it's one of the reasons why this website exists in the first place. But bear with me, we'll talk about that in a moment.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, among studying, I've been working at the IT industry for a while now. I started off by doing a lot of trainee work in companies and simple websites <a href="http://bit.ly/QVZBgs" target="_blank">like this</a> to my family and cousins. Later on, I worked as a software designer in the sports technology industry. Today, I am working as a systems specialist in the financial industry. And, if I were to describe my area of expertise: it's web development using Java/Ruby/JavaScript and a like. However, in order to keep this introduction brief, it's easier if you check out my <a href="http://linkd.in/1AxeVo9" target="_blank">linkedin profile</a>.
</p>

<p>
  But where's the fun? Don't worry, it's not that I haven't done anything else; I still see people outside the internet - I guess. But, within context of this website those stories are rather irrelevant as this website is about the epic journey I'm going to reveal. Therefore, trust me when I say this: you'll won't be seeing any blog posts regarding fashion, makeups and whatnot; Not from this site.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Now, let's move into the interesting part.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  I've also been making (and trying to make) games and other web applications on and off as long as I have been programming.
</p>

<p>
  At first, I used to make games using programs, such as Game Maker and RPG Toolkit. Later on I even tried C++/JavaScript/Python and various other things. Hence, a word "tried" is important here, because I often lacked focus, skills and motivation to finish. Sometimes I was just trying to make something too big, too soon. For instance, making of 2D MMORPG as one of the first games wasn't a good idea - it rarely is. For the record, it actually took ten years before I released my first <a href="http://bit.ly/1wQrrsG" target="_blank">MORPG experiment</a> during a game jam. But even then, it had bugs and didn't work well over wireless networks. Of course, I wanted to know why, so I even made a research about <a href="http://bit.ly/1v3sk2q" target="_blank">the effect of the internet on multiplayer game development</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Looking back now, releasing one or two crappy projects is way more important than starting three new ones as a excuse to "make it right this time". Hence, once I started to participate to local game jams and other open hacks held here in Oulu (Finland), I realized that it's okey to show off your crappy projects. After all, it's not like I mastered driving of a bicycle at a first, a third or even a tenth try; Making games nor applications is not easy. Thus, if it would, I wouldn't wanted to be a programmer at all.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, I feel that I have managed to achieve some great things in my life, but there is still a lot of great things to be achieved, which gets to the main purpose of this website: the epic journey.
</p>

<h2>The epic journey</h2>

<p><em>In short, the epic journey is about me trying to get better at making games and applications.</em></p>

<p>
  Hence, I sincerely believe that in order to do so, I need to be more systematic about it and find out what works and what doesn't. For this reason, I need people like you to help me out: to try out the games I'm developing and to leave a comment or two. However, what I need most is to set reasonable goals and to have focus. That being said, in 2015 I wan't to focus purely on making games.
</p>

<p><strong>But why should you care?</strong></p>

<p>
  Well, the changes are that you are also battling to become better at making games. Or maybe, you are just curious to see when a guy keeps failing every step of the way. However, at best my blog will serve you as a resource to avoid making the same mistakes. But now, let's see the goals I have for the year 2015.
</p>

<p><strong>Goal #1: To develop 2D MORPG from start to finish.</strong></p>

<p>
  This game will be part of my master thesis work, and I will be giving you more information later on. But, the primary motivation behind this study is to investigate the suitability of websocket protocol for multiplayer game development. In practise, this means a lot of writing, studying and developing. For this reason, I belive, that a goal #2 is something which could fail, but we'll see. Luckily, for you, I am going to write blog posts about the progress and issues I am facing while developing the 2D MORPG. Also, I'll try my best to share links to playable builds of the game. Yet, as I said, more details will follow.
</p>

<p><strong>Goal #2: To develop 6 games in a year.</strong></p>

<p>
  The purpose of this goal is to make me a better game designer, programmer and a human being. You see, games which I have released so far usually s*cks because my process of developing them (often within 48 hours) has been really, really bad. Therefore, I will be trying my best to alter the process I am using to develop games and follow the advices I have read from other game developers. For clarification, the games I am developing will be so called minimum viable products (MVPs). Thus, if you are unfamiliar with the term I recommend reading <a href="http://bit.ly/13TVmJy" target="_blank">blog post</a> written by the author of <a href="http://bit.ly/1Dbpi3s" target="_blank">onegameamonth</a>. That being said, I initially though that I would like to do onegameamonth challenge this year. But, because the goal #1 is so big - I simply canno't take more than I can chew.
</p>

<p>
  Okey, so there you have it. I hope you find these goals as interesting as I do. I have a lot of work ahead, but keeping things simple I believe I can succeed.
</p>

<p>
  Next time, I am going to look back and try to find out what wen't wrong with my previous games. Stay tuned.
