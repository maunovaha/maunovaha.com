- Fix to work with IE


- Do not take old ie? it seems that only difference is
  that it does not have media query stuff, however, we should code
  to work with media query browsers only and for e.g. ie 8 and up
  we include js to teach media queries

- Considering taking proper build of pure.css and the grid!

- Make welcome aboard footer to have a picture of landscape with a boat..!?
  - Then make upper side of the page to have part of the footer sky
  - As an alternative use current bg but make it as a ground of dirt/grass
