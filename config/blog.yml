title: Welcome to our new website
preview: > 
  After couple of months of designing and programming, I am delighted to announce the launch of our new website. 
  This site should not only work across multiple devices, but also be up-to-date in terms of content. Hence, 
  making a proper website is just one of the things I wanted to get done before making bigger and more 
  ambitious projects.
