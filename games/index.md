    <strong>
      A RPG in which a player can travel the world, level up and buy goods.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This game is one of the first games I have developed using Game Maker. I was around 15 years old and started to make a game which was too difficult to finish. Moreover, the game was supposed to be MORPG, but it ended up being a buggy single player game.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Platform(s):</strong>
    Windows
  </p>
  <p>

    Unfortunately, the game ended up being too bugful to be released as is. Hence, it should be completely rewritten after all these years anyway.
